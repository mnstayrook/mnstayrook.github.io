  <h2 class="subheader"> Biography </h2>
  <p class="basic">
    Maegan grew up with a strong desire to be a writer. Understanding how important a quality education
    is for her chosen career, Maegan attended
    college and graduated cum laude from the University of Georgia with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in
    English at only 19 years old. Still not satisfied, she enrolled in Full Sail University. Due to her
    academic achievements in the classroom, she received four Course Director Awards; each one is a
    distinct honor reserved only for a single student in that particular class who distinguishes
    themselves from their peers by demonstrating an in-depth understanding of the course material
    beyond the instructor&#8217;s expectations. At age 21, she graduated as the Valedictorian of her class
    with a Master of Fine Arts Degree in Creative Writing for the Entertainment Industry.
  </p>
  <p class="basic">
    She published her books and worked in the film industry for several years before discovering she still
    craved more. She researched courses to learn coding, an interest of hers since college, and jumped
    headfirst into an almost year-long bootcamp through MIT to learn how to program.
  </p>
  <p class="basic">
    Now, she is looking forward to exploring this new path she has taken and expand her horizons even further!
