  <h2 class="subheader"> Biography </h2>
  <p class="basic">
    Maegan grew up with a strong desire to be a writer. Understanding how important a quality education
    is for her chosen career, Maegan attended
    college and graduated cum laude from the University of Georgia with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in
    English at only 19 years old. Still not satisfied, she enrolled in Full Sail University. Due to her
    academic achievements in the classroom, she received four Course Director Awards; each one is a
    distinct honor reserved only for a single student in that particular class who distinguishes
    themselves from their peers by demonstrating an in-depth understanding of the course material
    beyond the instructor&#8217;s expectations. At age 21, she graduated as the Valedictorian of her class
    with a Master of Fine Arts Degree in Creative Writing for the Entertainment Industry.
  </p>
  <p class="basic">
    She published her books and worked in the film industry for several years before discovering she still
    craved more. She is a creator at heart, and always wants to try something new and innovative. 
    She researched courses to learn coding, an interest of hers since college. She jumped
    headfirst into a year-long bootcamp through MIT to learn how to program. She has enjoyed
    every minute of it, and she is looking forward to exploring this new path.
  </p>
  <p class="basic">
    She has begun a large-scale personal project called the Danarko Vault, which will be a collection of
    information about her books, such as characters, locations, historical events, and more. While she has
    created a Danarko Vault through Wix before, she was never satisfied with it and always felt like there
    could be more done to it. Now that she is learning coding, she is taking what she is learning and implementing
    it into her pet project. She is also creating automation tasks for herself to help with workflow and productivity.
