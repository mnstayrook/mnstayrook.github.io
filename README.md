# Maegan Stayrook's Portfolio

Welcome! This is Maegan Stayrook's Portfolio of her coding exercises through MIT's MERN Full Stack Development course and other projects she does as time passes. She created links and pages so you can easily navigate between her different works, and where possible, she tries to provide the opportunity to see her code live and in action.

You can contact her at maegan.stayrook@gmail.com.

Roadmap:
Currently, Maegan is actively working on this portfolio and plans to make huge strides in improving and upgrading this site. She wants to create it from scratch in order to learn the process, so she will not be using too many Bootstrap elements and will instead be implementing what she learns directly into the website or into her assignments to showcase her skills. When she does use Bootstrap, they will be marked.

Licenses: Many of the assignments have their own licenses attached to them, such as the MIT License for any MIT projects.
